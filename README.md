<p><b>The All-in-One Launcher for Goldstone County RP.</b>


Simplify your connection. Fix common crashes. Get in the game faster.</p> </div>

🚀 Key Features
🟢 One-Click Auto Join
Stop opening apps manually. The "ENTER GOLDSTONE (AUTO)" button handles everything:

Launch TeamSpeak 3.

Sets your Nickname automatically.

Opens RedM.

Connects you directly to the Goldstone County server IP.

⏱️ 67% Anti-Crash Monitor
Exclusive feature for players with connection issues or slow PCs:

The launcher actively monitors your RedM loading bar.

When loading hits the critical 67% mark, it automatically triggers the connection command.

Result: Prevents "Connection Failed" timeouts and infinite loading screens.

🛠️ Built-in Repair Tools
Fix common RedM bugs instantly without digging through files:

FORCE CLOSE REDM: Instantly kills RedM.exe if your screen freezes (keeps TeamSpeak open).

FIX VULKAN: Clears specific graphics cache files to fix "Out of Memory" errors and GPU crashes.

CLEAN CACHE: Performs a "Deep Clean" of temporary files to fix invisible textures or glitchy assets.

🔄 Auto-Updater
No need to redownload manually. The launcher checks for updates on startup and installs the latest version automatically.

🛡️ Security & False Positives
Is this safe? Yes. This is a free, open community tool. It never accesses your passwords, personal files, or browser data.

Why does my Antivirus warn me? You might see a "Unknown Publisher" or "Malicious.moderate.ml" warning.

The Reason: We are indie developers and do not pay the $500/year fee for a corporate "Digital Certificate" to sign the code.

The Fix: This is a False Positive. You can verify the file is clean on VirusTotal.

📥 How to Install
Download the latest Goldstone.Launcher.exe from the Releases Page.

Run the installer.

If Windows SmartScreen appears, click "More Info" → "Run Anyway".

Enter your TeamSpeak name and click ENTER GOLDSTONE (AUTO)!
