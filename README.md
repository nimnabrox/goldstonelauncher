## 🚀 Key Features

### 🟢 **One-Click Auto Join**
Stop opening apps manually. The **"ENTER GOLDSTONE (AUTO)"** button handles everything:
* Launches **TeamSpeak 3**.
* Sets your **Nickname** automatically.
* Opens **RedM**.
* Connects you directly to the **Goldstone County** server IP.

### ⏱️ **67% Anti-Crash Monitor**
Exclusive feature for players with connection issues or slow PCs:
* The launcher actively monitors your RedM loading bar.
* When loading hits the critical **67%** mark, it automatically triggers the connection command.
* **Result:** Prevents "Connection Failed" timeouts and infinite loading screens.

### 🛠️ **Built-in Repair Tools**
Fix common RedM bugs instantly without digging through files:
* **FORCE CLOSE REDM:** Instantly kills `RedM.exe` if your screen freezes (keeps TeamSpeak open).
* **FIX VULKAN:** Clears specific graphics cache files to fix "Out of Memory" errors and GPU crashes.
* **CLEAN CACHE:** Performs a "Deep Clean" of temporary files to fix invisible textures or glitchy assets.

### 🔄 **Auto-Updater**
* No need to redownload manually. The launcher checks for updates on startup and installs the latest version automatically.

## 🛡️ Security & False Positives

### **Is this safe?**
**Yes.** This is a free, open community tool. It **never** accesses your passwords, personal files, or browser data.

### **Why does my Antivirus warn me?**
You might see a *"Unknown Publisher"* or *"Malicious.moderate.ml"* warning.
* **The Reason:** We are indie developers and do not pay the $500/year fee for a corporate "Digital Certificate" to sign the code.
* **The Fix:** This is a **False Positive**. You can verify the file is clean on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).
